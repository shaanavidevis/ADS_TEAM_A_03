**ABSTRACT**
       
       Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of cognitive impairment in adults at age more than 65, which leads to high treatment costs and contributes to elderly mortality. Early detection using machine learning is vital to reduce risks. This research aims to create a computer aided Alzheimer's detection system. Neurodegenerative changes in brain affect memory and function, posing significant social and economic challenges. Early analysis is more effective. We have used machine learning techniques such as support vector machine with Oasis data set to predict Alzheimer's evaluated by precision recall accuracy and F1 score.This research involves a comprehensive data set making up Alzheimer Patients mild cognitive impairment individuals and healthy controls this data set. Here classifiers were trained and tested from the database that we have showed and even several classifiers were compared and combined for a decision through voting. To achieve this, we have implemented machine learning and Python using SVM models. In conclusion predictions of Alzheimerâ€™s disease are based on the measured parameters like accuracy, precision, recall for support vector machine (SVM) model. The proposed classification scheme can be used by doctors to make diagnosis of Alzheimer disease based on the accuracy from the output.
